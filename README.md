# Automated MOM

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating and simplifying the process of generating and sharing Minutes of Meeting (MoM). This tool is designed to convert audio or video files into editable text conversations, which are then processed to produce detailed meeting summaries and MoM. The project aims to:

Enable quick transcription of meetings into textual conversations.
Summarize these conversations into actionable and editable MoM for organizational use.
Provide a streamlined and efficient way to delegate and manage MoM emails with minimal manual intervention.
The editable nature of the generated MoM ensures flexibility, allowing users to make adjustments before finalizing and using them as per their needs.

## Scope
This project addresses the immediate need to automate transcription and summarization of meetings, significantly reducing manual effort in producing MoM. The tool currently supports:

Audio/Video Transcription
Converts recorded meetings into text conversations.
Meeting Summarization
Generates detailed and concise MoM from transcribed text.
Outputs editable text for customization.
Long-Term Vision:
The project aspires to evolve into a real-time web application capable of:

Attending live meetings on behalf of the user.
Providing real-time transcriptions and MoM during or after meetings.
By beginning with transcription and summarization, the project lays the groundwork for achieving its broader goal of enabling fully automated meeting assistance for organizations.
